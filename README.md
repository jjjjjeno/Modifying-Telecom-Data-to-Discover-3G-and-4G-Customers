# Modifying-Telecom-Data-to-Discover-3G-and-4G-Customers

The goal of this project is to separate the customer's list into two groups of customers: one group uses 3G cell phone network and the other group are customers who use 4G network.
The data frame has been explored, identified, cleaned and modeled to provide demographic data to discover the probabilities of a customer switching to a 4G network.
